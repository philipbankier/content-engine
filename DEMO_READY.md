## 🐛 Known Issues (All Acceptable for Demo)

### Non-Critical Issues
1. **Skills show "warning" health** - All skills flagged as "not validated in last 7 days"
   - **Why:** Normal for demo data - skills haven't run live
   - **Impact:** None for demo narrative
   - **Fix if needed:** Ignore or explain as "seeded historical data"

2. **Tracker agent timezone error** - One scheduled task fails with timezone comparison
   - **Why:** Edge case in metrics collection
   - **Impact:** Doesn't affect demo views or data
   - **Fix if needed:** Already logged, doesn't crash system

3. **Only 3 version files created** - Expected 8+ skill version markdown files
   - **Why:** Seeding script only creates files for 2 skills, rest are in DB only
   - **Impact:** Database has all 6 evolved skills correctly
   - **Fix if needed:** None needed - DB is source of truth for demo

4. **Cost is $40 vs expected $127** - Seeding created fewer agent runs
   - **Why:** Randomization in agent run seeding
   - **Impact:** Still shows strong cost efficiency story ($86/month vs $45K)
   - **Fix if needed:** Adjust narrative to actual cost or re-seed

## 🚨 If Something Breaks

### Dashboard Won't Load
```bash
# Check if system is running
curl http://localhost:8001/pipeline

# If not responding, restart
pkill -f "python main.py"
sleep 2
nohup python main.py > /tmp/autopilot.log 2>&1 &

# Wait 5 seconds, then test
sleep 5
curl http://localhost:8001/skills | python -m json.tool | head
```

### Data Looks Wrong
```bash
# Verify data
python scripts/verify_demo_ready.py

# If shows issues, re-seed
python scripts/seed_demo_data.py

# Then restart
pkill -f "python main.py" && sleep 2
nohup python main.py > /tmp/autopilot.log 2>&1 &
```

### Skills Not Showing Evolved Versions
```bash
# Check database directly
sqlite3 autopilot.db "SELECT name, version, confidence FROM skill_records WHERE version > 1;"

# Should show 6 rows
# If empty, re-seed: python scripts/seed_demo_data.py
```

### Check Logs
```bash
# Real-time logs
tail -f /tmp/autopilot.log

# Recent errors
tail -100 /tmp/autopilot.log | grep ERROR
```
