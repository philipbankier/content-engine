# Optimal Posting Windows

## When to Use
Apply when scheduling content publications across platforms.

## Core Patterns
- LinkedIn: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am ET. Tuesday 9am is the single best slot.
- Twitter: Monday-Friday, 8-9am and 12-1pm ET. Thursday and Friday slightly stronger.
- YouTube Shorts: 2-4pm ET (catches afternoon browse + evening watch). Consistent daily beats optimal timing.
- Medium: Tuesday-Wednesday mornings. Avoid weekends (low traffic).
- TikTok: 7-9pm ET (evening leisure). Weekends slightly stronger for entertainment content.

## Cross-Platform Spacing
- Never publish same topic on two platforms within 2 hours (cannibalization risk)
- Stagger: LinkedIn (morning) → Twitter (midday) → YouTube/TikTok (evening)
- Medium articles: publish 24-48 hours after social posts (allows social to drive initial traffic)

## Timezone Considerations
- Primary audience: US (ET timezone as baseline)
- Secondary: EU (UK/CET) — morning posts hit EU afternoon
- Weekend posting: lower competition but also lower traffic (net positive for new accounts)

## What to Avoid
- Posting LinkedIn on weekends (30% less reach)
- Publishing Medium articles on Friday afternoon (lowest read rate)
- Multiple posts on same platform within 4 hours (cannibalization)
