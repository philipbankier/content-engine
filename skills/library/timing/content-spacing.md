# Content Spacing

## When to Use
Apply when planning content cadence and avoiding platform fatigue.

## Core Patterns
- LinkedIn: maximum 1 post per day. Posting twice within 4 hours cannibalizes both posts.
- Twitter: 1-3 tweets/day is sustainable. Threads count as one unit.
- YouTube Shorts: 1 per day optimal. 3-5/week minimum for algorithmic favor.
- Medium: 2-3 articles per week maximum. Quality >> quantity.
- TikTok: 1-3 per day is fine (TikTok rewards volume more than other platforms).

## Topic Spacing
- Same topic across platforms: stagger by 4-6 hours minimum
- Same topic on same platform: wait 72+ hours
- Related but different angles: can be closer (24 hours)
- "Series" content: daily cadence is fine if each piece adds new insight

## Content Mix
- 60% timely (arbitrage content from discoveries)
- 25% evergreen (frameworks, how-tos, analysis)
- 15% engagement (replies, comments, community participation)

## Fatigue Signals
- Declining engagement rate over 3+ consecutive posts = reduce frequency
- High impressions but low engagement = content quality issue, not timing
- Unfollows spike = too frequent or off-brand content

## What to Avoid
- Posting same content to multiple platforms simultaneously
- "Batching" all weekly content into one day
- Ignoring platform-specific cadence norms
- Treating all platforms the same way
