# Veo3 Visual Generation

## When to Use
Apply when generating B-roll footage, visual transitions, or abstract visuals for video content.

## Core Patterns
- Use for B-roll segments between avatar clips (8-12 second cuts)
- Abstract tech visuals work best: data flowing, neural network visualization, code on screens
- Prompt pattern: "Cinematic shot of [subject], [style], [movement], 4K, professional lighting"
- Keep clips 3-8 seconds — longer generations have more artifacts
- Pair with voiceover rather than standalone

## Prompt Templates
- Tech B-roll: "Close-up of code scrolling on a modern monitor, shallow depth of field, blue ambient lighting, smooth dolly shot"
- Abstract: "Abstract visualization of data flowing through a neural network, dark background, glowing blue and purple nodes, slow rotation"
- Office: "Modern tech office, person working at standing desk with multiple monitors, natural lighting, slow tracking shot"

## What to Avoid
- Generating faces (uncanny valley risk)
- Text in generated video (always garbled)
- Clips over 10 seconds (quality degrades)
- Over-relying on generated footage (mix with real content)
