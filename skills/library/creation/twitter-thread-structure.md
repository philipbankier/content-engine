# Twitter Thread Structure

## When to Use
Apply when creating Twitter/X threads from discovered content.

## Brand Voice
Calm, confident, technical, grounded. Builder-to-builder. No buzzwords, no exclamation points, no sales CTAs. Short paragraphs, declarative statements, minimal adjectives, one idea per paragraph.

## Core Patterns
- Thread length: 5-8 tweets optimal. Longer loses readers. Shorter lacks substance.
- Tweet 1: bold claim or surprising insight (this is the hook — determines 90% of reach)
- Tweet 2: context/setup — why this matters now
- Tweets 3-6: the substance — one idea per tweet, concrete examples
- Final tweet: synthesis, not a CTA. "This is where things are heading."
- Each tweet should stand alone — some readers see individual tweets in feeds

## Format Rules
- No tweet exceeds 240 chars (leave room for engagement)
- Use line breaks within tweets for readability
- Numbers and data points increase saves/bookmarks
- Code snippets or pseudo-code get high engagement in tech threads

## What to Avoid
- "Thread :thread:" as first word (dated, signals low quality)
- Numbered tweets ("1/8") in the text — threading handles this
- Asking for retweets or follows
- More than one emoji per tweet
- Self-promotional final tweets
