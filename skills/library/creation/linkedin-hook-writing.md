# LinkedIn Hook Writing

## When to Use
Apply when creating the opening lines of LinkedIn posts. The hook determines 80% of engagement.

## Brand Voice
Calm, confident, technical, grounded. Builder-to-builder. No buzzwords, no exclamation points, no sales CTAs. Short paragraphs, declarative statements, minimal adjectives, one idea per paragraph.

## Core Patterns
- Question hooks: "What happens when..." — creates curiosity gap
- Contrarian hooks: "Most teams are wrong about..." — challenges assumptions
- Data hooks: "We analyzed 1,000 AI deployments..." — establishes authority
- Story hooks: "Last Tuesday, our system caught something..." — narrative pull
- Statement hooks: "The future of work isn't AI replacing humans." — bold claim

## Structure
1. Hook line (< 15 words, no hashtags)
2. One-line expansion
3. Blank line (forces "see more" click)
4. Body content (3-5 short paragraphs)
5. Closing thought (no CTA, no question)

## What to Avoid
- Starting with "I'm excited to announce..."
- Exclamation points anywhere
- Hashtag-heavy openings
- "Revolutionary", "game-changing", "leverage AI"
- Questions that sound rhetorical or salesy
