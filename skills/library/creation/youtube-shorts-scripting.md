# YouTube Shorts Scripting

## When to Use
Apply when writing scripts for YouTube Shorts (< 60 seconds).

## Brand Voice
Calm, confident, technical, grounded. Builder-to-builder. No buzzwords, no exclamation points, no sales CTAs. Short paragraphs, declarative statements, minimal adjectives, one idea per paragraph.

## Core Patterns
- Open with a hook in first 3 seconds — make a claim or ask a surprising question
- Total script: 120-150 words for 45-55 second delivery
- Structure: Hook (3s) → Context (8s) → Insight 1 (12s) → Insight 2 (12s) → Conclusion (10s)
- Direct-to-camera opening retains 40% more viewers than text overlays
- End with a thought, not a CTA — "That changes everything about how we build." not "Subscribe for more"

## Script Template
```
[HOOK - 3 seconds]
{Surprising claim or question}

[CONTEXT - 8 seconds]
{Why this matters right now}

[INSIGHT 1 - 12 seconds]
{Core technical insight with concrete example}

[INSIGHT 2 - 12 seconds]
{Implication or second-order effect}

[CLOSE - 10 seconds]
{Synthesis — what this means for builders}
```

## What to Avoid
- Starting with "Hey guys" or "What's up"
- Asking to subscribe or like
- Background music that competes with voice
- Scripts over 160 words (too rushed)
- Jargon without instant explanation
