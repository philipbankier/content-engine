# Medium Article Format

## When to Use
Apply when creating Medium articles from discovered content.

## Brand Voice
Calm, confident, technical, grounded. Builder-to-builder. No buzzwords, no exclamation points, no sales CTAs. Short paragraphs, declarative statements, minimal adjectives, one idea per paragraph.

## Core Patterns
- Title: 6-12 words, specific, no clickbait. Include one keyword.
- Subtitle: expand on the title, add context or a question
- Length: 800-1500 words (5-7 minute read)
- Structure: Introduction → Problem → Insight/Analysis → Implications → Conclusion
- Use subheadings every 200-300 words
- Include 1-2 code blocks or data points for technical credibility
- First paragraph must establish "why now?" — timeliness is the arbitrage

## Formatting
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Bold key phrases sparingly
- Bullet lists for comparisons or steps
- One pull quote for emphasis
- End with "what to watch" not "what to do"

## What to Avoid
- Listicles ("Top 10 AI tools")
- Clickbait titles
- More than 2000 words (readers drop off)
- Generic conclusions ("AI is changing everything")
- Self-promotional content or links to products
