# Reddit Signal Detection

## When to Use
Apply when scanning Reddit for trending AI/automation content.

## Core Patterns
- Cross-posting velocity: same topic in 3+ subreddits within 6 hours = breakout signal
- r/MachineLearning posts with 200+ upvotes reliably translate to LinkedIn
- r/LocalLLaMA practical tutorials get highest engagement when reformatted for YouTube Shorts
- Comment sentiment ratio: mostly positive + "how do I use this?" = strong creation signal
- Award-heavy posts indicate emotional resonance (good for narrative-style content)

## Subreddits to Monitor
r/MachineLearning, r/artificial, r/LocalLLaMA, r/singularity, r/ChatGPT, r/OpenAI, r/automation, r/SaaS

## What to Avoid
- Meme-heavy posts (don't translate to professional platforms)
- Posts with < 50 upvotes (insufficient signal)
- Drama/controversy threads (brand risk)
