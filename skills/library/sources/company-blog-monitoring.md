# Company Blog Monitoring

## When to Use
Apply when processing RSS feed items from major AI company blogs.

## Core Patterns
- Major product announcements (new models, APIs, features) have 2-4 hour arbitrage window
- Pricing changes always generate discussion — create comparison content immediately
- Research blog posts from Anthropic/OpenAI get highest LinkedIn engagement
- "How we built X" posts from engineering blogs translate well to Twitter threads
- Safety/alignment posts generate controversy — handle with care

## Blogs to Monitor
- OpenAI Blog (openai.com/blog)
- Anthropic News (anthropic.com/news)
- Google DeepMind Blog (deepmind.google/discover/blog)
- Meta AI Blog (ai.meta.com/blog)
- Hugging Face Blog (huggingface.co/blog)

## What to Avoid
- HR/hiring announcements (no content value)
- Duplicate coverage of same announcement (watch for cross-posting)
- Speculative interpretation of minor updates
