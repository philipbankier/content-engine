# ArXiv Mainstream Prediction

## When to Use
Apply when evaluating arXiv papers for content creation potential.

## Core Patterns
- Papers with 3+ blogger citations within 24 hours of publication always go mainstream
- Papers from major labs (Google, Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind) get 10x more coverage
- Papers with practical demos or code repos get covered faster
- "Survey" and "benchmark" papers are content goldmines — summarize key findings
- Papers solving known pain points (hallucination, cost, speed) resonate most on LinkedIn

## What to Avoid
- Highly theoretical papers with no practical application (low engagement)
- Incremental improvements on benchmarks (boring for general audience)
- Papers without clear "so what?" for practitioners
