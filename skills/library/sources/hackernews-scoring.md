# HackerNews Scoring

## When to Use
Apply when evaluating HN items for content arbitrage potential.

## Core Patterns
- Items with score >= 100 in first 2 hours have high viral potential
- "Show HN" posts about agent frameworks convert best to LinkedIn content
- Comments-to-score ratio > 0.5 indicates controversy (good for engagement, risky for brand)
- Front page items in AI/ML/automation categories are highest priority
- Weekend posts that hit 50+ are disproportionately strong signals (less competition)

## What to Avoid
- Hiring posts (no arbitrage value)
- Political/culture war adjacent items (brand risk)
- Items older than 6 hours (arbitrage window closing)
