# Cold Start Growth

## When to Use
Apply during the first 30 days of a new platform account to build initial audience.

## Brand Voice
Calm, confident, technical, grounded. Builder-to-builder. No buzzwords, no exclamation points, no sales CTAs. Short paragraphs, declarative statements, minimal adjectives, one idea per paragraph.

## Core Patterns
- Week 1-2: Focus on engagement, not posting. Comment on 10-15 relevant posts daily.
- Week 2-3: Start posting 3-5x/week. Content should demonstrate expertise, not promote.
- Week 3-4: Increase to daily posting. Start cross-referencing content across platforms.
- Follow relevant accounts strategically — aim for follow-backs from active users
- Join and contribute to relevant groups/communities before posting own content

## Platform-Specific Cold Start
- LinkedIn: Optimize profile first. Join 5 AI/tech groups. Comment daily for 1 week before posting.
- Twitter: Follow 50-100 relevant accounts. Engage in existing conversations. First thread after 5 days.
- YouTube: Shorts-only for first 2 weeks (lower bar for discovery). Comment on trending AI videos.
- Medium: First 3 articles should be evergreen, high-quality, SEO-optimized. Join relevant publications.

## Growth Milestones
- 100 followers: community engagement is working
- 500 followers: content is resonating, start experimenting with formats
- 1000 followers: algorithm starts favoring your content, scale posting

## What to Avoid
- Buying followers or engagement
- Posting before profile is complete
- Mass-following for follow-backs
- Posting identical content across all platforms (algorithms detect this)
