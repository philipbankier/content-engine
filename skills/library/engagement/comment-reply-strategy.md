# Comment Reply Strategy

## When to Use
Apply when responding to comments on published content across all platforms.

## Brand Voice
Calm, confident, technical, grounded. Builder-to-builder. No buzzwords, no exclamation points, no sales CTAs. Short paragraphs, declarative statements, minimal adjectives, one idea per paragraph.

## Core Patterns
- Reply within 2 hours of comment (signals activity to algorithms)
- Match commenter's depth — short comment gets short reply, thoughtful gets thoughtful
- Add genuine insight in replies, not just "thanks" or "great question"
- Ask follow-up questions to drive conversation depth
- Acknowledge valid criticism directly — never deflect
- Technical questions: provide specific, actionable answers

## Reply Templates by Type
- Agreement: "Exactly. And the second-order effect is [insight]."
- Question: "[Direct answer]. We've seen [specific example]."
- Criticism: "Fair point. [Acknowledge]. What we've found is [counter with data]."
- Skepticism: "Healthy skepticism. Here's what the data shows: [specific metric]."

## What to Avoid
- Generic responses ("Thanks for sharing!")
- Exclamation points or emojis in replies
- Defensive tone when criticized
- Pitching or promoting in replies
- Ignoring negative comments (looks evasive)
