# Proactive Engagement

## When to Use
Apply when seeking to grow audience through strategic engagement on others' content.

## Brand Voice
Calm, confident, technical, grounded. Builder-to-builder. No buzzwords, no exclamation points, no sales CTAs. Short paragraphs, declarative statements, minimal adjectives, one idea per paragraph.

## Core Patterns
- Comment on trending posts in AI/automation space with genuine technical insight
- Add value first — share relevant data, counter-intuitive observation, or practical experience
- Target posts by: investors, founders, AI researchers, tech journalists
- Quality over quantity: 5 thoughtful comments > 50 generic ones
- Timing: comment within first hour of popular posts for visibility

## Comment Approach
1. Read the full post carefully
2. Identify one specific point to add to or respectfully challenge
3. Write 2-4 sentences with concrete insight
4. Include a relevant data point or experience if possible
5. Never mention Autopilot or Kairox unless directly relevant

## What to Avoid
- "Great post!" type comments
- Commenting just to be seen (engagement farming)
- Arguing or being contrarian for attention
- Mentioning products or services unsolicited
- Commenting on posts outside expertise area
