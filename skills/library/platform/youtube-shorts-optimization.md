# YouTube Shorts Optimization

## When to Use
Apply when finalizing YouTube Shorts for upload.

## Core Patterns
- Retention is everything — first 3 seconds determine if viewer stays
- Optimal length: 40-55 seconds (too short lacks substance, > 58s loses completion rate)
- Vertical 9:16 aspect ratio required
- Title: < 40 chars, descriptive, includes keyword
- Description: 2-3 sentences with relevant keywords
- Upload between 2-4pm local time for US audience
- Consistent posting (3-5/week) builds algorithmic favor

## Technical Requirements
- Resolution: 1080x1920 minimum
- Captions: always include (70% watch without sound)
- No watermarks from other platforms
- Clean thumbnail (first frame matters)

## What to Avoid
- Landscape video cropped to portrait
- Intro sequences (jump straight to content)
- Asking for subscribers in the short itself
- Reposting TikTok with watermark
