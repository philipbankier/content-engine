# Twitter/X Optimization

## When to Use
Apply when finalizing content for Twitter/X publishing.

## Core Patterns
- Single tweets: < 200 chars get more engagement than max length
- Threads: 5-8 tweets optimal. Self-thread reply within 2 minutes of first tweet.
- Images boost engagement 150%. Videos boost 200%. But text-only tweets get more algorithmic reach.
- Best posting times: 8-9am and 12-1pm weekdays. Thursday and Friday are strongest.
- Quote tweets with added insight outperform simple retweets 5:1
- Engagement in first 30 minutes determines viral trajectory

## Reply Strategy
- Reply to replies within first hour (signals activity to algorithm)
- Ask genuine follow-up questions (not "great point!")
- Bookmark-worthy content: data, frameworks, step-by-step gets saved and shared

## What to Avoid
- Posting more than 3x per day (timeline fatigue)
- Thread tweets that are just filler
- Engagement bait ("RT if you agree")
- More than 2 hashtags (spam signal on Twitter)
