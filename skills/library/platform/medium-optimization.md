# Medium Optimization

## When to Use
Apply when finalizing content for Medium publishing.

## Core Patterns
- Article length sweet spot: 800-1500 words (5-7 minute read)
- First 100 words determine whether readers continue - front-load value
- Publish in relevant publications for wider distribution (Towards Data Science, etc.)
- Include 1-2 images to break up text and improve engagement
- Optimal posting: Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-12pm EST
- Add canonical URL if cross-posting to get SEO credit
- Use Medium's built-in code blocks for technical content

## Tag Strategy
- Maximum 5 tags (Medium enforces this)
- First tag is most important (appears in URL)
- Mix: 1 broad (Artificial Intelligence), 2 medium (Machine Learning, Automation), 2 niche
- Check tag popularity before publishing (use tags with 10K+ followers)

## SEO Optimization
- Title should include primary keyword naturally
- Use H2/H3 subheadings with secondary keywords
- Alt text for all images
- First paragraph should include target keyword
- Medium ranks well in Google - treat as SEO opportunity

## Curation and Distribution
- Articles under 800 words rarely get curated
- Technical depth signals quality to curators
- Original research or data gets priority
- Avoid promotional content - immediate rejection from curation

## What to Avoid
- Articles under 500 words (low engagement)
- More than 5 tags
- Clickbait titles (hurts curation chances)
- External links in first 200 words
- Cross-posting identical content without canonical URL
- Publishing at night or weekends (lower distribution)
