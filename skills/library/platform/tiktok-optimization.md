# TikTok Optimization

## When to Use
Apply when finalizing content for TikTok publishing.

## Core Patterns
- Hook in first 1-2 seconds is non-negotiable (swipe rate highest here)
- Optimal length for tech content: 30-45 seconds
- Completion rate is the primary algorithm signal — shorter often = more completions
- Text overlays help — many watch without sound
- Trending sounds can boost reach 3x but must feel natural
- Post 1-3x daily for algorithmic favor (more is fine on TikTok vs other platforms)
- Duets and stitches with relevant creators amplify reach

## Content Style for Tech/AI
- Explain like you're talking to a smart friend, not lecturing
- Screen recordings with voiceover work well for technical demos
- "Things you didn't know about X" format performs consistently
- Controversy-adjacent takes get reach but manage brand risk

## What to Avoid
- Overly polished/corporate feel (TikTok rewards authenticity)
- Videos over 60 seconds without strong hook
- No text overlays (most watch muted)
- Ignoring comments (engagement signals matter)
