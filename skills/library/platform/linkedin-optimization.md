# LinkedIn Optimization

## When to Use
Apply when finalizing content for LinkedIn publishing.

## Core Patterns
- Post length sweet spot: 150-300 words. Under 100 gets ignored. Over 500 loses attention.
- First 3 lines must hook — LinkedIn truncates at ~210 chars with "see more"
- Posts with images get 2x engagement. Carousels get 3x.
- Posting time: Tuesday-Thursday 8-10am local time for B2B audience
- Avoid links in post body (algorithm penalizes). Put links in first comment.
- Native document (PDF carousel) posts get highest algorithmic reach
- Dwell time is the #1 ranking signal — write content people pause to read

## Hashtag Strategy
- 3-5 hashtags maximum
- Mix: 1 broad (#AI), 1 medium (#automation), 1-2 niche (#agenticAI, #contentops)
- Place at bottom, not inline

## What to Avoid
- External links in post body (use comments)
- More than 5 hashtags (spam signal)
- Posting more than once per day (cannibalization)
- Generic motivational content
- Tagging people for engagement bait
