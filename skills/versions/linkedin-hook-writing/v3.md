# LinkedIn Hook Writing v3

## When to Use
Apply when creating the opening lines of LinkedIn posts. The hook determines 80% of engagement.

## Brand Voice
Calm, confident, technical, grounded. Builder-to-builder. No buzzwords, no exclamation points, no sales CTAs. Short paragraphs, declarative statements, minimal adjectives, one idea per paragraph.

## Core Patterns (REFINED)
- **Technical question hooks [PRIMARY]**: "How does [system] actually handle..." or "Why does [behavior] happen when..."
  - Technical 'how' questions: 1.4x boost over generic questions
  - Technical 'why' questions: 1.3x boost over generic questions
- **Counter-intuitive questions**: "Why is [common practice] actually wrong?"
- Data hooks: "We analyzed 1,000 AI deployments..." — establishes authority
- Story hooks: "Last Tuesday, our system caught something..." — narrative pull

## Best-Performing Question Types (by engagement)
1. "How does X actually work?" (technical deep-dive)
2. "Why does Y happen when..." (debugging mindset)
3. "What happens when [unexpected combo]?" (curiosity)
4. "When should you ignore [conventional wisdom]?" (contrarian)

## Structure
1. Technical question hook (< 15 words)
2. One-line answer preview (creates information gap)
3. Blank line (forces "see more" click)
4. Body content (3-5 short paragraphs, technical but accessible)
5. Closing insight (no CTA, no question)

## What to Avoid
- Generic questions ("What is AI?")
- Yes/no questions
- Exclamation points anywhere
- "Revolutionary", "game-changing", "leverage AI"
- Questions about feelings or opinions

## Performance Notes
Evolution: v1 (0.5) → v2 question focus (0.67, +34%) → v3 technical refinement (0.82, +22%)
Pattern: Technical how/why questions in our niche = 2.8x baseline engagement
Uses: 73 | Success rate: 88% | Last validated: day 9
