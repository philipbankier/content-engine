# LinkedIn Hook Writing v2

## When to Use
Apply when creating the opening lines of LinkedIn posts. The hook determines 80% of engagement.

## Brand Voice
Calm, confident, technical, grounded. Builder-to-builder. No buzzwords, no exclamation points, no sales CTAs. Short paragraphs, declarative statements, minimal adjectives, one idea per paragraph.

## Core Patterns (UPDATED)
- **Question hooks [PRIMARY]**: "What happens when..." — creates curiosity gap (2.1x engagement boost)
- Contrarian hooks: "Most teams are wrong about..." — challenges assumptions
- Data hooks: "We analyzed 1,000 AI deployments..." — establishes authority
- Story hooks: "Last Tuesday, our system caught something..." — narrative pull
- Statement hooks: "The future of work isn't AI replacing humans." — bold claim

## Question Hook Formulas
- "What happens when [unexpected combination]?"
- "Why do [surprising fact]?"
- "How does [technical detail] actually work?"
- "When should you [contrarian advice]?"

## Structure
1. Hook line (< 15 words, preferably a question)
2. One-line expansion
3. Blank line (forces "see more" click)
4. Body content (3-5 short paragraphs)
5. Closing thought (no CTA, no question)

## What to Avoid
- Starting with "I'm excited to announce..."
- Exclamation points anywhere
- Hashtag-heavy openings
- "Revolutionary", "game-changing", "leverage AI"
- Rhetorical or salesy questions

## Performance Notes
